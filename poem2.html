  <b>The Kiss</b>
    <br><br><body>
<p><center>My mouth blooms like a cut. <br>I've been wronged all year, <br><br>tedious <br><br>nights,<br><br>nothing but rough elbows in them <br>and delicate boxes of Kleenex calling <br><br>crybaby, crybaby, <br><br> you fool!</center></p>
  <p><center> Befeore today my body was useless. <br>Now it's tearing at its square corners. <br> It's tearing old Mary's garments off <br><br>knot by knot <br><br>and see-- Now it's shot full of these electric bolts. <br><br> Zing! A Resurrection! </center></p>
  <p><center>Once it was a boat, quite wooden <br>and with no business, no salt under it <br>and in need of some paint. <br><br>It was no more than a group of boards. <br><br>But you hoisted her, <br><br>rigged her. <br> <br>She's been elected. </center></p>
  <p><center> My nerves are turned on. <br>I hear them like musical intruments. <br>Where there was a silence <br><br>the drums, the strings <br>are incurably playing. <br><br>You did this. <br><br>Pure genius at work. <br><br>Darling, the composer has stepped into fire. </center></p>

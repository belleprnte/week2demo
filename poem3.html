  <body>
<br><p align=right>My mouth blooms like a &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cut. <br>I've been wronged all year, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;tedious <br>nights, nothing but rough elbows in &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; them <br>and delicate boxes of Kleenex calling &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; crybaby <br>crybaby, you &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; fool!</p>
<br><p align=right>Before today my body was &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; useless. <br>Now it's tearing at its square &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; corners. <br>It's tearing old Mary's garments off, knot by &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; knot. <br>and see-- NOw it's shot full of these electic &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; bolts.<br>Zing! A &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; resurrection!</p>
<br><p align=right>Once, it was a boat, quite &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; wooden <br>and with no business. no salt water under &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; it <br>and in need of some paint. It was no &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; more <br>than a group of boards. But you hoisted her, rigged &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; her. <br>She's been &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; elected.</p>
<br><p align=right>My nerves are turned on. I hear them &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; like <br>musical intruments. Where there was &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; silence <br>the drums, the strings are incurably playing. You did &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; this. <br>Pure genius at work. Darling the composer has &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; stepped <br>into &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; fire. </p>
